# Purdue Landing Pages

Disables standard Page and Post content types and creates a new Landing Page post type.  

## Description
Establishes a WordPress site dedicated to campaign specific landing pages.  Enabling this plugin results in the standard "POST" and "PAGE" content types being removed from your website.  This plugin also removes the permalink setting forcing the site to behave based on the default setting of %postname% as the slug.

This plugin was created to work with a customized template within the Purdue Branded Theme.  The template contains a minimal branded footer to meet legal requirements and provide the most flexibility possible to the landing page creators.  In order to leverage this plugin with other themes, you will need to create a template file named single-lndngpg.php
